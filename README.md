# Exploration Game
A procedural maze-solving game to earn as many points as possible. This was one of my first projects. I'm adding it to GitHub for archiving purposes.

### Rules
1. Use arrow keys or the buttons to the right to move "P"
2. Reach "F" to advance to the next level
3. "+" -> Increases health by 5
4. "-" -> Decreases health by 5
5. "#" -> Teleports the character to a random location
6. "â™¥" -> Heal completely 
  
 
### visibleOnly()
 This function makes it so that the player can only see a 3x3 area around "P". The only way to activate it is uncommenting it in the code.
